# INDUSTRY_COPPER_MODELLING

The Industry Copper Modelling project aims to build predictive models to estimate the selling price of copper based on various features. This project involves extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of various machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.
Key Features:
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Data has been collected from various sources, cleaned, and preprocessed to ensure quality inputs for the model.
Feature Engineering: Transformations and manipulations of features, such as logarithmic transformations and encoding categorical variables, to enhance model performance.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of various regression models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost to predict the selling price of copper.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation of model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of model parameters using techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for improved accuracy.
Visualization: Use of visualizations such as heatmaps, box plots, violin plots, and distribution plots to understand data distribution and feature relationships.

The Industry Copper Modelling project provides a comprehensive approach to building predictive models for copper selling prices. By following this workflow, you can preprocess data, engineer features, train and evaluate models, and visualize data insights effectivel
